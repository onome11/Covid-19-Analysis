***COVID-19 Epidemiological Analysis in Africa***

This analysis examines COVID-19 trends across Africa, focusing on new cases, testing, ICU occupancy, and vaccination progress. We developed two dashboards:

    Africa New Cases Dashboard â€“ Tracks infections, testing, and hospital capacity.
    Vaccination & Mortality Dashboard â€“ Analyzes deaths, vaccinations, and healthcare impact.

Key Metrics:

    Total & New Cases â€“ Identifies outbreak trends.
    Positivity Rate & ICU Occupancy â€“ Measures healthcare burden.
    Case Fatality Rate (CFR) â€“ Assesses disease severity.
    Vaccination Rate â€“ Evaluates immunization efforts.

Using DAX measures, we identified the Top 5 most populated African countries and compared infection, testing, and mortality rates. This analysis supports data-driven public health strategies. ðŸš€
